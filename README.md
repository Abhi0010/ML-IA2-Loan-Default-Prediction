# ML-IA2-Loan-Default-Prediction
Used machine learning models to predict loan default prediction

Several banks rely on credit scores for determining if loans can be sanctioned to a particular customer or not. It is important to know the credit worthiness of a particular loan applicant as it helps them decide whether a loan can be sanctioned or not. Defaulters can cause a significant amount of losses for the bank, which makes loan default prediction a necessity. As machine learning has gathered traction, banks are now leveraging machine learning to predict if loans should be sanctioned or not. The objective here is to build machine learning models to predict loan default prediction using given dataset.
